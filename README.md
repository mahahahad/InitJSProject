# InitJSProject
Bash script to initialize a blank JavaScript project.

Since I find myself making the same files and folders everytime I want to start a new JavaScript project, I decided to just make a bash script to easily do that for me.

Place the shell script in your .local/bin folder and you can then call it from anywhere and it'll setup the files and folders for you in that folder.
