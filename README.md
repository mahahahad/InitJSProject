# InitJSProject

Bash script to initialize a blank JavaScript project.

Since I find myself making the same files and folders everytime I want to start a new JavaScript project, I decided to just make a bash script to easily do that for me.

Place the shell script in your .local/bin folder and you can then call it from anywhere and it'll setup the files and folders for you in that folder.

## Requirements

HTML Server - Python  
Sass Compiler - SASS

At the end of the file, I've included a sass and HTML server script. These aren't really that important so you can remove them but if you choose to keep it you must have python and sass installed.
